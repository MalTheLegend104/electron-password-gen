# electron-password-gen
A password generator written with the node.js and electron.js frameworks.

# Update 1.5.2
This update brings the user settings menu, allowing for themes, an option to automatically copy generated passwords, and a default value so you dont have to input a value for the password every time. Along with the new UX, there was a lot of backend changes to make things operate more smoothly and seemlessly, and it also is a whole lot more readable than it was before.

# Future Plans
I plan to add a zip folder containing the .exe and program files later this week, making it as simple to run as downloading it and running the exe. The next, and likely last, update of this program will add some more settings to make it as conveient as possible to use, like automatically keeping the settings for the checkboxes, and potentially user customizable themes. The last update will also probably contain an installer, so you don't have to worry about trying to get it set up yourself.

# Known Bugs
These Bugs are know and are actively being worked on. 
â€¢ Problem when saving settings if the program is saved to Progam Files, or other restriced folders.

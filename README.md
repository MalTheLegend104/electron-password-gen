# Breakfast Galaxy Studios - Password Gen
A password generator written with the node.js and electron.js frameworks.

## Final Update 1.6.0
This update brings some QOL changes in the settings, the ability to exclude letters from the password (essentially meaning you can use it as a RNG too), custom themes, and actually fixed saving settings (sorry for the troubles caused in the last update).

## Future Plans
• There will be no feature updates from here on out, unless there is major support behind one feature. <br>
• Hot Fixes will be avaiable as bugs are discovered and patched. <br>

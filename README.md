# electron-password-gen
A password generator written with the node.js and electron.js frameworks.

## Usage
Currently this project has very few dependancies, with the only requirements being that node.js is installed, and you have electron to run it. There will be an executable for download in the future, but as of now you should just download it and run it.

### Running
If you download the source code, open a terminal in the directory where `index.js`, `index.html`, and `package.json` are. Assuming you have electron installed, you should be able to run the command `npm start` and it will open the program.

## Future
In the future I plan to add a download and potentially an installer, but neither of these are guaranteed.

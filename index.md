### What is it?
It's an open source password generator. You get to see the code behind the password generation, and rest well knowing that nothing is logging your created passwords in the background. It's got plenty of QOL features to make generating a password quick, effiecient, and customizable. 

### Future
There are currently no planned updates for this program. If a feature gets requested enough it may be added, but nothing is planned.
